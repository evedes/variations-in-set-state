I've done this repo to show some important stuff about setState() in React.

You can read my article "Get Pro with React setState in 10 minutes in [Medium](https://medium.com/@evedes/get-pro-with-react-setstate-in-10-minutes-d38251d1c781)

And check the live example working in [Glitch](https://freezing-transport.glitch.me/)
